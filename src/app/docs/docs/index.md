# Welcome to Sieve Documentation

Sieve uses AI agents to perform fast, accurate data extraction from any format such as PDF, image, or video. Data can be seamlessly converted into text, tables, forms, or any other format compatible with your existing workflow. 

There are 2 options for using using Sieve: UI and API. UI is perfect for users who want to use a simple web interface to submit their requests, rather than writing code. The API is for engineers, developers, and other users who would like to access the product through code, providing the option to integrate Sieve into existing ETL pipelines. 

See our UI and API quick start guide to get started!
